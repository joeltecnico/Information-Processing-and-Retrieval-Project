		BERLIN — Remember that harmless radioactive cloud that mysteriously drifted across Europe back in September? Turns out it may indeed have come from Russia after all — from an area that had radioactivity of about 1,000 times higher than normal, as officials there acknowledged for the first time Tuesday. Experts emphasized that the unusually high levels may still have been harmless. [&#8230;]]]></description>

		Tuesday, Nov. 21, 2017. It is a date that has now entered the annals of history. Robert Gabriel Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president of 37 years, announced his resignation amid a military intervention and unprecedented street protests in the military's favor. He is 93 and was the oldest head of state in the world. His ouster comes after [&#8230;]]]></description>
